            Diplomatic Emunity is a tower defense style game in which you are tasked by the government to protect the crops of farmers from the savage emu hoards and their generals. Can you survive the emu pest infestation?
            (Note: As my first Unity project, I was unsure on how to go about programming this. In addition, the entire team was made up of programmers. The team pulled through with the game and came out with this, which I am happy with. I did design and programming.)
