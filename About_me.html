        <p>Hi, I'm Marshall. Born June 10 2004 in the north west of england, I am reletively skilled in what I do in the games industry. After studying game design at preistley college, I didn't know where to go from there, so I decided to leave the comfort of the north to learn at falmouth university, taking the Computing for Games course</p>
