            <p>
                Fishy Shark was made for another internal game jam in college, where we set out to make a game similar to overcooked. Just like other game jams, there isn't really much to talk about.

            <h3 style= "text-align: left;">The game - an elevator pitch:</h3>
            <p> Fishy shark 3D is a fast paced single player cooking sim game in a similar vein to Overcooked. Fish are friends, but food for sharks, and you're the best chef for them. Be warey, they get rather impatient and will snap if left hungry. </p></div>
