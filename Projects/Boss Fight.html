            <p>
                This was designed to be a C++ module, as both the Game Dev: Programming and the Computing For Games course got it. I was excited to properly get into it, however due to time constraints I could only do one C++ script.
                This module also sparked a resentment towards poor documentation, which thankfully it has somewhat gotten better for Unreal Engine, though it is also understandable why it is difficult to use the Documentation, as the engine was suppose to be
                for in-house use only. Nonetheless, this was when I learnt that all previous projects are of dubious optimisation and was half tempted to go back and attempt to optimise them.

            <h3 style= "text-align: left;">Project Discription:</h3>
            <p> This Project is a boss battle between you and a wizard in his tower. It was used to test my knowledge on optimising C++ and an Unreal Project.</p>
