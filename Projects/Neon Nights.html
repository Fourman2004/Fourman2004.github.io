            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Commentary:</h3>
            <p> This project was undertaken after a heated conversation with my team during the second year at uni, towards the end of the project. It was based on an idea I had at the very start of the year that never got passed ideation.
                The idea behind this game was similar to a game like Warhammer 40,000 Space Hulk: Death Wing, where you explore abandoned ruins in europe whilst dealing with the occult. Whilst the conversation that led to the prototyping of this game could've gone better, It taught me a valuble lesson in Team communication and allowed me to develop agile skills a bit more.
                Overall, whilst I do want to return to developing this, I think it will be a good idea to pivot the artstyle and game feel.  
            </p>
            <h3 style= "text-align: left;">The game - an elevator pitch:</h3>
            <p> Neon Nights is a 3D movement shooter when you descend the layers of a neon-lit hellscape.</p>
