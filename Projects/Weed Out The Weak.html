            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Commentary:</h3>
            <p> This was a Game for the Global Game Jam in 2023 whilst I was in first year. I was mainly stuck on UI programming Which at the time I absolutely dispised, as it was my first time doing anything in C# on my own without any help outside of documentation. Overall, for this project though it was still my first taste of a large-scale game jam, and I enjoyed it.</p>
            <h3 style= "text-align: left;">The game - an elevator pitch:</h3>
            <p> Play as either Pip or Bud in this 2-player 2D local multiplayer fighting game set within the foliage of the garden</p>
