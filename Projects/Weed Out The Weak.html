            <p> This was a Game for the Global Game Jam in 2023 whilst I was in first year. I was mainly stuck on UI programming Which at the time I absolutely dispised, as it was my first time doing anything in C# on my own without any help outside of documentation. Overall, for this project though it was still my first taste of a large-scale game jam, and I enjoyed it.</p></div><br>
