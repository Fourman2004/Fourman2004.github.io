<h1> Soldier's Silhouette</h1>

<p>Commentary:<br>
Soldier's Silhouette was the first group game I have worked on, and
where I learnt a fair amount of my current knowledge of Unreal from a
Gameplay design aspect. The aim of the game was to be a verticle slice
for a horror game, which from a design aspect, didn't work as a good
horror game, though everything programmed into the game worked. With it
being my first game in the team, I was surprised to be tackling
everything from general AI to UI and Gameplay, to things such as audio
programming. At the time of it's development, I wasn't taught how to
properly debug or optimise the code, so it is rife with memory leaks
and other bugs.<br>
<br>
The game - an elevator pitch:<br>
the Game is a psychological horror game based around World war 2. You
are a soldier, recovering from PTSD, and you must exit the medical
facility you're in whilst an apperation of your brother, who has died
in front of you prior to awaking in the hospital in the pacific
theater, haunts your vision.<br>
