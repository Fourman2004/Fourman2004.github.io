            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Commentary:</h3>
            <p> I was originally intending for this to be in Unreal engine, though due to complications, resorted to using unity. This also sparked a deep resentment, this time for convoluted and 
                and poorly documented code. I distinctly remember the first time I tried to use an example repo that was given, and was told the way you have it generate multiple meshes was to make vectors of vectors, and refactor the code to be vectors of vectors.
                Overall, I didn't enjoy the process until I was left to my own devices. When I was left alone this was possibly the most thought-provoking and interesting project I undertook during university.

            <h3 style= "text-align: left;">Project Discription:</h3>
            <p> This project is comprised of two things: an OpenGL script, showcasing the bare bones of a openGL system, and another in Unity, which will generate terrain based on adjustable variables.</p></div>
