            <p> Aislinn is my third and final university project. after a shaky ending to the last project, I was hesitent to do work on another unreal project in a team. Nonetheless, This was came to be.
                At the beginning there was three programmers, yet one intermitted. This project was one of my favourites to work on, primarily because I got to try things I wouldn't noramlly do or even knew about.
                I did have my issues with some of the team members, mainly with getting cut off when trying to explain something. Overall, This was much better than last year.
