            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Commentary:</h3>
            <p> Out of all the games I worked on, this 2nd year University game was by far the most mentally taxing, though it taught me a lot in terms of team communciation. Throughout this project I felt like I was the only one doing anything, asit felt like no one wanted to work on it. Communication between team members was non-existant, I barely recived feedback on my work and my advice was ignored. 
                Out of everyone in the team, only the artists and the programmers knew how to use unreal engine, and I felt myself doing more and more by myself.
                Eventually, towards the end of it, A heated discussion took place between me and my writer, where I was asked if I wanted to stay in the team or not. throughout my ideas and advice were either thrown out or ignored this discussion was a breaking point, where I promptly left for the majority of the remaining time due to the enviroment I was in, though coming back to work on the Expo materials.
                In hindsight, the game isn't bad, just (for lack of a better term) Underbaked. If I was to do a game similar to this again, I would want clearer communications and better agile practices, in addition to having time to optimise the game in any way, shape and/or form.
