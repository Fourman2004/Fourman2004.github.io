            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Commentary:</h3>
            <p> Simple Pie was made for the 2024 Global game jam. This time around was mainly for seeing how I would work in my third year team, along with developing my unity skills even further.
                Overall, this was a simple (pie) one that was mildly fun to do (Primarily because I could mess around in front of the camera used to live stream the event, as it was mostly pointing in my direction)
            </p>
            <h3 style= "text-align: left;">The game - an elevator pitch:</h3>
            <p> Simple pie is a 1st person survival shooter where you play as an unwilling participant from the crowd at a circus. Fight the clowns with their own "weapons": Pie!</p>
