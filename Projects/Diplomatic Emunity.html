            <p> Diplomatic Emunity was my first unity project, along with my first group project for university. Personally, I quite enjoyed creating this game, despite having a team of Only Programmers.
                Nonetheless, This Project was small, sweet and it's creation was quite comical. I found myself to be in-between my role of programmer and that of a designer.

            <p> Diplomatic Emunity is a 2D tower defense game made in unity and based on the Emu war of 1932  with a pixel artstyle. You defend your farm from a myriad onslaught of Emu's.</p></div>
