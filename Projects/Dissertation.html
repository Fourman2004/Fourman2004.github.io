            My Dissertation is on Player Engagement, where I took fellow GA students and had them play through a small game I created, before documenting the results to do graphs and analysis on.
            I took ample precaution when conducting this, given it's subject area, along with it dabbling in people and, because of that, a social science. It was my first time using G*Power, and proper Scientific methodology
            Overall, it was the most stressful project I've done, but also the most rewarding.

            <p> The Project is on Player Engagement and Game Obsession, with the main two questions being on finding a relatively concise and accurate variable, which for this paper is time, and the perception of OGA from the participants</p>
