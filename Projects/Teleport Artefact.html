<h1> Teleportation Artefact<br>
</h1>

<h3 style= "text-align: left;">Commentary:</h3>

<p>This Artefact was made during my second year at college towards the start of and alongside my group project, where we were tasked with making what we wanted related to what discipline we wanted to go into.
 I decided on creating and excercising my skills by creating a teleportaion parkour course, experimenting with different methods of displacing the player. Whilst the creation of the artefact was an enjoyable process, 
It was difficult to motivate myself to document the project the way that was required.</p>

<h3 style= "text-align: left;">Project Description:</h3>
<p>This project is a bare-bones prototype of a parkour game utilising teleportation mechanics. It uses one on the player, similar to a "blink" type teleport, one that is more reminiscent of a typical portal, and one "random" teleport, with it's own specialised zones.</p>
