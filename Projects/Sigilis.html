            <p> Sigilis was a personal project created for the 15th Pirate Jam, that I undertook alone. Creating the game wasn't incredibly hard, though I did find creating the document and building to HTML5 a rather jarring and difficult task.
                Overall, I enjoyed the process as it taught me more about game design and broaderning my abilities.

            <p> Play as an unnamed wizard ridding a realm of threats in this top-down shooter, use the runes you collect to aid in this endevour</p></div>
