            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Commentary</h3>
            <p>This game was created for the 2025 Global Game Jam, and the creation of this game is another silly one based on a dream one of my other programmers had, which included a hamster JPEG hue-shifted red called "Roberts". My work during this was the creation of a Spawn system for the Obstacles in the game, along with the main menu.
                You will notice on the Global Game jam page that I am called "Marshall Jencil Sharpener", which is what my designer put down and I cannot edit the page so then it displays my actual legal name.
                Overall, this is the Stupidest (good connotation) game I have worked on throughout my time as a games programmer.
            </p>
            <h3 style = "text-align: left;">The game - an elevator pitch</h3>
            <p> You play as Roberts, a red hamster, travelling through ocean currents in an effort to beat your long-time rival Jeve Sobbs and regain your honour.</p>
